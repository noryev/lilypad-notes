What are the problems I am facing.

  Basically, after starting up all the lilypad services locally, when we got to ./stack bacalhau-node there is a problem with a port already being in use is blocked. 

    We tried to use the various flags within bacalhau but none worked. Possibly a docker passing the variable problem or it could be an issue with ./stack and --network-port 4223. 

  How do we reassign this port communication on port 4222? It does not seem too logical to change the port on Jupyter Notebooks. 

  What is the ideal solution here? Fix the port assignment on IPFS? You have to be running jupiter notebooks for the UI and everything within the instance. There is a solution here no doubt!
